Data science bootcamp project 1

The goal of this project was to look futher at the 120 years of Olympic dataset from Kaggle. For this analysis we identified limitations, cleaned the data for our dissection, and identified 3 research questions & a regression.

Our research questions were all based off the main theme of what is the impact of hosting and physical attributes on Olympic performance and participation. 

Our Questions:
One: Has one country hosted more than others in the last 30 Olympic Occurrences? Does
hosting the olympics impact percentage of medals won by home country?
Two: What is the age distribution for the Summer & Winter Olympics? Which sport(s) have the highest
average age?
Three: Does height or weight impact which sport someone is likely to compete in? Has the average height or weight
changed over the last 30 Olympic occurences?
Bonus T-Test: Is the average height or average weight significantly different for the Summer and Winter Olympics?
Regression: Does age impact whether or not an athlete is more likely to medal?

Our Conclusions:

Hosting appears to impact percentage of medals won by the hosting team. While we
    canâ€™t draw any relationship conclusions, it does appear that hosting increases the percentage of medals won.

Age plays a role in the sport an athlete plays. The data shows signs that athletes who experience more longevity are those that do not play sports that do not require as much physical stress on the body or require more experience.

Height and weight appear to influence performance in Olympic sports, with taller, heavier athletes excelling in sports like basketball and volleyball, while shorter, lighter athletes tend to excel in sports like gymnastics.

Height and weight appear to be increasing since 1960. While neither is a straight upward trend, both height and weight are higher than they were in the 1960 Olympics.

An Olympians age, height, and weight are not good linear indicators of athletes who earn a high number of medals
